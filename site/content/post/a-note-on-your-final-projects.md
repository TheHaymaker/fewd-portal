The Final Project assignment is the hallmark project for FEWD. And while there are some technical & functionality requirements - pretty much any idea can be steered to meet the criteria.

This is a friendly reminder to begin thinking about what you want to build. For now - these are the things I would recommend keeping in mind:

* Do you get excited by the concept / idea? 
* If so - what exactly makes your excited about it?
* Will the concept help you achieve your larger goals?
* Don't worry or think about any requirements at this point. Just follow your curiosity and imagination.
* More than one idea is better than a single idea.

Around week four I'll be reaching out to you to review your ideas and help you fine-tune them so that they are achievable within the time frame of the class, as well as help you form a plan to execute your idea. We'll also review the exact requirements for the final project at that time, too, as well as project milestones throughtout the remainder of the course. 

By week 5: your idea should be solid.
