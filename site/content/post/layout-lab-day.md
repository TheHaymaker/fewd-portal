You'll work with a group to execute as much of the Startup Matchmaker page layout as possible.

My recommendations for the lab:

1. Break the project into chunks
2. Discuss and think through your plan of attack BEFORE coding anything (drawing it out helps)
3. Make clear roles for you and your teammates.
4. By the end of class, be sure to push your code to a repo so it can be shared with the rest of the group.
