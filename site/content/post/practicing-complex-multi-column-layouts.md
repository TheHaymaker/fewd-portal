If you want to practice more complex layouts - like the one above - you can access complex layouts that utilize **floats **as well as **flexbox** (an attribute which we'll spend time on next week) [here](https://thehaymaker.github.io/layouts/).

Remember that our float-based layouts follow a convention of a 12-column layout. 

These layouts generally follow a pattern of:

* container
  * row
    * column
      * content
    * column
      * content
